e24PaymentPipe Python Class
===========================

  This project contains a pure Python implementation
  of the ACI Worldwide Payment Gateway that is used
  by many payment gateway providers.

  Usually, the implementation kit comes with a few
  reference implementations of the payment gateway, but they
  are only available as a Java class, or a .dll library.

  So this python class was created for those of us that do
  not use Java or ASP.NET/.dlls for their development.

  The library has successfully been used in production.

  
  Quick Start
  -----------

  `
    from e24PaymentPipe import e24PaymentPipe as gw
    g = gw(resource='somefile.cgn',alias='somealias)
    try:
      g.parse()
    except e:
      print e
    
    trackid = 12343
    try:
       r = g.transaction(errorurl='http://www.google.com/',
                         responseurl='http://www.google.com/',
			 trackid=trackid,
			 amount=1)
    except e:
       print e

    print('Payment ID: %s' % r[0])
    print('Payment URL: %s' % r[1])
  `
